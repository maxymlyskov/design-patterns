# Design Patterns in Java

Welcome to the **Design Patterns in Java** project! This repository showcases various design patterns implemented in Java. Each pattern is implemented in a dedicated module with relevant examples and documentation.

## Patterns

### Adapter
Implemented the Adapter pattern.
- **Description**: The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.

### Bridge
Implemented the Bridge pattern.
- **Description**: The Bridge pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

### Chain of Responsibility
Implemented the Chain of Responsibility pattern.
- **Description**: The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until one of them handles the request.

### Composite
Implemented the Composite pattern.
- **Description**: The Composite pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

### Decorator
Implemented the Decorator pattern.
- **Description**: The Decorator pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### Facade
Implemented the Facade pattern.
- **Description**: The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.

### Flyweight
Implemented the Flyweight pattern.
- **Description**: The Flyweight pattern reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects by sharing as much data as possible.

### Mediator
Implemented the Mediator pattern.
- **Description**: The Mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to each other explicitly.

### Observer
Implemented the Observer pattern.
- **Description**: The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### Proxy
Implemented the Proxy pattern.
- **Description**: The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### Visitor
Implemented the Visitor pattern.
- **Description**: The Visitor pattern allows you to add further operations to objects without having to modify them.
